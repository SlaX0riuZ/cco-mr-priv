An all-in one, functioning program allowing users to determine a statistical average amount of materials spun in a given session.

Designed for the game "Cube Collector Online", developed by AspectQuote.

## Functionality

### These items are implemented as base functionality! Expect these to be part of the program.

Allows users to input the time spent AFKing on a given box, and outputs statistical material rewards at the end of session.

Also allows users to find the best box for any given material, excluding ones that aren't determined by box (Valuable Respite, Slated Chips, Divine Fragments, Tally Dregs, Prefix Remnants)

Allows users to input whether they are halfspinning, or using tally mods.

Gives estimated chance of rolling a Slated/Divine in AFK session, given tally mods.

Gives Unreal/Exotic percent chance from total AFK session, given tally mods. Nobody ever uses exotic multiplier mods, do they?

## FAQ

### Will you use golds and exotics in your calculations?

Nope. Too small of a chance versus reward-- even cubics are iffy but are just enough to have me include them.

### How do I run this?

Download the .zip file, unpack it into a folder-- upload into VSCode (make sure you have python installed as an extension on it, and have Python on your computer)
